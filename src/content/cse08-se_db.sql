INSERT INTO `isad_casestudy` VALUES (1,7,'A Library Information System for SE VLabs Institute','<p> The SE VLabs Institute has been recently setup to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of Software Engineering.

The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.

An user makes a request to issue a book against his account.\r\nThis is shown by the &quot;issueBook(bookID)&quot; call from &quot;Member&quot; to &quot;IssueManager&quot;\r\nobjects. At this point the system checks whether that particular user can issue another book (based on the maximum \r\nnumber of books that he can issue) by invoking the &quot;canIssue()&quot; method on the &quot;Member&quot;. As a\r\nresult of this call, a response (&quot;status&quot;) is sent back to the &quot;IssueManager&quot; class. If the\r\n&quot;status&quot; is &quot;true&quot; (as indicated in the note), status of the concerned book is set to &quot;issued&quot;.\r\nA new transaction is saved corresponding to the current issue of book by the user. Finally, a success message is\r\nsent back to &quot;Member&quot; indicating that the book was successfully issued.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n    <img src=\"_STATIC_URL_/isad/images/case_study/class_seq_dia/seq_issue_book.png\" alt=\"Issue book sequence diagram\"\r\n    class=\"diagram\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    Figure 1: Sequence diagram for &quot;Issue Book&quot;\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFew points could be noted here. Notes can be used almost anywhere within an UML diagram for whatever purpose.\r\nIn figure 1 we use a note to specify the condition when status of a book is set to \'issued\'. UML 1.0 had used guard \r\nconditions to specify such kind of Boolean logic. UML 2.0 provide components to specify the alternate scenarios\r\nwithin a sequence diagram (not discussed here). One can definitely make use of these components. However, if the\r\nnumber of IF-THEN-ELSE conditions in a sequence diagram becomes high, the diagram gets complicated. In such cases\r\none can draw multiple sequence diagrams for alternate conditions. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne key component in figure 1 is the &quot;IssueManager&quot; class. This class doesn\'t represent the actual\r\nLibrary Information System (LIS). Rather, this is a part of LIS -- a specific module to handle issuing of books to the\r\nmembers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlso, note that the life cycle of the &quot;Transactions&quot; has been shown as self-destroyed. To understand\r\nthis, consider how a transaction is actually implemented in code. One creates an object from &quot;Transactions&quot;\r\nclass, fills it up with all necessary information, and then saves the transaction. Thereafter, the transaction \r\nobject is not required to be in memory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFigure 2 shows the order of steps involved in the process of purchasing of a new book. In this case also, &quot;PurchaseManager&quot;\r\nis a part of LIS, which manages all books that are being purchased. The activation bars indicate the different\r\ninstances when a particular object is active in their corresponding life cycles. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n    <img src=\"_STATIC_URL_/isad/images/case_study/class_seq_dia/seq_purchase_books.png\" alt=\"Purchase books sequence diagram\"\r\n    class=\"diagram\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    Figure 2: Sequence diagram for &quot;Purchase Books&quot;\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne may have doubts over the inclusion of &quot;Distributor&quot; class. &quot;Distributor&quot; is not a constituent of the LIS;\r\nhowever, it interacts with LIS. Here &quot;Distributor&quot; is meant to represent the &quot;interface&quot; between LIS\r\nand the actual, physical book sellers and distributors. For instance, LIS can store details of distributor XYZ, including it\'s\r\nemail address, bank account number, into it\'s records. Whenever the librarian places a new order to XYZ, the order is being sent\r\nelectronically to XYZ, processed (possibly with a delay), a corresponding invoice is generated, and sent back to LIS. &quot;placeOrder(orderID)&quot; \r\nhas been indicated as asynchronous calls since the calling object can continue with other tasks. The books\r\nwould be dispatched by XYZ physically, which lies outside the boundary of LIS. Once the ordered books have been received, the\r\nlibrarian opts to make payment for his orders, which, too, could happen electronically through Net Banking. Technology has, indeed,\r\nmade a huge progress!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, at his leisure time, the librarian might consider updating the inventory according to the corresponding order.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nClasses are the fundamental components of any object oriented design and development. Unless individual class, it\'s attributes and\r\nassociated operations have been modeled well, a lot of suffereing could await during the development phase. However, unlike waterfall\r\nmodel, the life cycle in object oriented development is iterative. One builds a model, analyze it\'s efficiency, and refines it\r\nthereafter, if required. Therefore, an analyst, designer, or developer doesn\'t have the tight constraints to create a perfect art\r\nat one go.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBased on conceptual modeling and domain knowledge we already had identified a list of classes. We present them here once again:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul> \r\n    <li>Member</li> \r\n    <li>Book</li> \r\n    <li>Transaction (of books)</li> \r\n    <li>Librarian</li> \r\n    <li>Employee</li> \r\n    <li>Book Inventory</li> \r\n    <li>Distributor</li> \r\n    <li>Order</li> \r\n    <li>Order Line Item</li> \r\n    <li>Payment</li> \r\n    <li>Invoice</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLet\'s focus on the &quot;Member&quot;, &quot;Librarian&quot; and &quot;Employee&quot; classes. The &quot;Employee&quot; class\r\ncould be considered as a parent class, some of whose properties are inherited by the &quot;Member&quot; class. Again, &quot;Librarian&quot;\r\nis just a special type of &quot;Member&quot; with certain extra privileges. However, it may be noted here that LIS in no way\r\nwould be interested to know about employees who are not members of LIS. Moreover, to distinguish between a normal member\r\nand a librarian, one could define a set of roles, and assign them appropriately to the members. This approach provides\r\na flexible approach to manage users. For example, if the librarian goes on a leave, another member could be assigned the\r\nlibrarian role temporarily. Therefore, we decide to have a single &quot;Member&quot; class, whose instances could have one\r\nor more roles. This is shown in figure 3 with the &quot;association&quot; relationship between &quot;Member&quot; and &quot;Role&quot;\r\nclasses. The &quot;Role&quot; class could consist of a list of available roles. A list could be maintained in the &quot;Member&quot; class\r\nto indicate which roles are associated with a particular instance of it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<div style=\"width: 850px; overflow: scroll;\"  class=\"diagram\">\r\n    <img src=\"_STATIC_URL_/isad/images/case_study/class_seq_dia/class_1.png\" alt=\"Class diagram for LIS\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    Figure 3: A simplified class diagram for LIS\r\n</div>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe &quot;LIS&quot; class consists of several modules: &quot;RegistrationManager&quot;, &quot;IssueManager&quot; &quot;ReturnManager&quot;,\r\nand &quot;PurchaseManager&quot;. Their &quot;composition&quot; relationship with &quot;LIS&quot; indicates that any of these individual\r\nmodules wouldn\'t exist without the existence of &quot;LIS&quot;. The &quot;IssueManager&quot; class is responsible for issue and reissue\r\nof books while considering the two-times reissue constraint placed on a book.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe relation between &quot;IssueManager&quot; class and &quot;Book&quot; class is shown as &quot;weak dependency&quot;. This is due to the reason\r\nthat the &quot;IssueManager&quot; class do not require a &quot;Book&quot; as it\'s member variable. Rather, when an user has issued a book, the\r\nconcerned method in &quot;IssueManager&quot; just needs to update the status of the corresponding book. No instance of &quot;Book&quot; needs to be\r\ncreated. The arrow from &quot;IssueManager&quot; to &quot;Book&quot; indicates that only the former knows about the &quot;Book&quot; class.\r\nThe relationship between &quot;PurchaseManager&quot; and &quot;Distributor&quot; is, however, not a weak dependency. The\r\n&quot;PurchaseManager&quot; class has a member variable of type &quot;Distributor&quot;, which keeps track of the distributor selected\r\nfor the current purchase.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith the classes so identified, the code for issue book could look as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"_STATIC_URL_/isad/lib/SyntaxHighlighter/scripts/shBrushJava.js\"></script>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: java;\">\r\npublic ID IssueBook(ID userID, ID bookID) {\r\n    Member user = Member.GetMember(userID);\r\n    ID transactionID = null;\r\n    if ( user.canIssueNow() && Book.IsAvailable(bookID) ) {\r\n        Book.SetStatusIssued(bookID);\r\n        user.incrementIssueCount(bookID);\r\n        BookTransaction transaction = new BookTransaction(userID, bookID);        \r\n        transaction.save();\r\n        transactionID = transaction.getID();\r\n    }\r\n    return transactionID;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe code for reissuing a book to an user could look like the following.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"brush: java;\">\r\npublic ID ReissueBook(ID userID, ID bookID) {\r\n    Member user = Member.GetMember(userID);\r\n    ID transactionID = null;\r\n    if ( user.canIssueNow() && Book.IsAvailable(bookID) ) {        \r\n        Integer count = user.getReissueCountFor(bookID);    // # of times this books has been reissued after it\'s recent issue by the user\r\n        if ( count < REISSUE_LIMIT ) {        \r\n            user.incrementReissueCount(bookID);\r\n            BookTransaction transaction = new BookTransaction(userID, bookID);        \r\n            transaction.save();\r\n            transactionID = transaction.getID();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return transactionID;\r\n}\r\n</pre>'),(3,6,'A Library Information System for SE VLabs Institute','<p>\r\nThe SE VLabs Institute has been recently setup to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of Software Engineering.

For users\' who don\'t have an \r\naccount already and have submitted their registration forms, the librarian verifies the information provided, possibly\r\nagainst the central database used by the institution. If all information have been provided correctly, librarian goes on\r\nwith creating a new account for the user. Otherwise, the user is asked to provide all and correct information in his (her)\r\nregistration form. Once a new account has been created for the user, he (she) is being issued an ID card, which is to be\r\nprovided for any future transaction in the library.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNote that in the above diagram two swim lanes haven been shown indicated by the labels <i>User</i> and <i>Librarian</i>.\r\nThe activities have been placed in swim lanes that correspond to the relevant role.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the major events that occur in any library is issue of books to it\'s members.

This means, one\r\ndoesn\'t have to complete the task of addition of all new books before doing any removal. Merging of these two activities\r\nand the subsequent <i>Update inventory</i> activity indicates that it is not required to complete all addition and\r\nremovals before proceeding to update the database. That is, a few books could be added, then update the database, then\r\nagain continue with the tasks.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, the workflow terminates when all addition and removal tasks have been completed.\r\n</p>'),(4,1,'A Library Information System for SE VLabs Institute','<p>\r\nThe SE VLabs Institute has been recently setup to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of Software Engineering.

From the above, even without doing\r\nany deep analysis, we might easily identify some of the basic functionality of the system:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><strong>New user registration:</strong> Any member of the institute who wishes to avail the facilities of \r\n  the library has to register himself with the Library Information System. On successful registration, a user ID \r\n  and password would be provided to the member. He has to use this credentials for any future transaction in LIS.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Search book:</strong> Any member of LIS can avail this facility to check whether any particular book is\r\n  present in the institute\'s library. A book could be searched by its:\r\n    <ul style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\r\n        <li style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Title</li>\r\n        <li style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Authors name</li>\r\n        <li style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Publisher\'s name</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><strong>User login:</strong> A registered user of LIS can login to the system by providing his employee ID \r\n  and password as set by him while registering. After successful login, &quot;Home&quot; page for the user is shown from\r\n  where he can access the different functionalities of LIS: search book, issue book, return book, reissue book.\r\n  Any employee ID not registered with LIS cannot access the &quot;Home&quot; page -- a login failure message\r\n  would be shown to him, and the login dialog would appear again. This same thing happens when any registered user\r\n  types in his password wrong. However, if incorrect password has been provided for three time consecutively, the\r\n  security question for the user (specified while registering) with an input box to answer it are also shown. If\r\n  the user can answer the security question correctly, a new password would be sent to his email address. In case\r\n  the user fails to answer the security question correctly, his LIS account would be blocked. He needs to contact\r\n  with the administrator to make it active again.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><strong>Issue book:</strong> Any member of LIS can issue a book against his account provided that:\r\n    <ul style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\r\n        <li style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The book is available in the library i.e. could be found by searching for it in LIS</li>\r\n        <li style=\"font-size: 1em;\">No other member has currently issued the book</li>\r\n        <li style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Current user has not issued the maximum number of books that can</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    If the above conditions are met, the book is issued to the member. \r\n    <br>\r\n    Note that this FR would remain <strong>incomplete</strong> if the \"maximum number of books that can be issued\r\n    to a member\" is not defined. We assume that this number has been set to four for students and research scholars, and\r\n    to ten for professors.\r\n    <br>\r\n    Once a book has been successfully issued, the user account is updated to reflect the same.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><strong>Return book:</strong> A book is issued for a finite time, which we assume to be a period of 20 days. \r\n  That is, a book once issued should be returned within the next 20 days by the corresponding member of LIS. After \r\n  successful return of a book, the user account is updated to reflect the same.\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li><strong>Reissue book:</strong> Any member who has issued a book might find that his requirement is not over\r\n  by 20 days. In that case, he might choose to reissue the book, and get the permission to keep it for another 20\r\n  days. However, a member can reissue any book at most twice, after which he has to return it. Once \r\n  a book has been successfully reissued, the user account is updated to reflect the information.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a similar way we can list other functionality offered by the system as well. However, certain features might not be\r\nevident directly from the problem system, but which, nevertheless, are required. One such functionality is \"User\r\nVerification\". The LIS should be able to judge between a registered and non-registered member. Most of the functionality\r\nwould be available to a registered member.

This team has been given the task to execute the Library Information System project.\r\nThe team consists of a few experts from industry, and a batch of highly qualified engineers experienced with design and implementation of\r\ninformation systems. It is planned that the current project will be undertaken by a small team consisting of one expert and few engineers.\r\nActual team composition would be determined in a later stage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUsing COCOMO and based on the team size (small) and experience (high), the concerned project could be categorized as &quot;organic&quot;. \r\nThe experts, based on their prior experience, suggested that the project size could roughly be around 10 KLOC. This would serve\r\nas the basis for estimation of different project parameters using basic COCOMO, as shown below:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    Effort = a * (KLOC)<sup>b</sup> PM\r\n    Tdev = 2.5 * (Effort)<sup>c</sup> Months\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor organic category of project the values of a, b, c are 2.4, 1.05, 0.38 respectively. So, the projected effort required for this project becomes\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    Effort = 2.4 * (10)<sup>1.05</sup> PM\r\n           = 27 PM (approx)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo, around 27 person-months are required to complete this project. With this calculated value for effort we can also approximate the\r\ndevelopment time required:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    Tdev = 2.5 * (27)<sup>0.38</sup> Months\r\n         = 8.7 Months (approx)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo, the project is supposed to be complete by nine months. However, estimations using basic COCOMO are largely idealistic. Let us refine\r\nthem using intermediate COCOMO. Before doing so we determine the Effort Adjustment Factor (EAF) by assigning approprite weight to each of\r\nthe following attributes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"

Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by the institution.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe final deliverable would a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text. \r\n</p>','<p>\r\nA robust database backend is essential for a high-quality information system. Database schema should\r\nbe efficiently modeled, refined, and normalized. In this section we would develop a simple ER model\r\nfor the Library Information System.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first step towards ER modeling is to identify the set of relevant entities from the given problem\r\nstatement. The two primary, and obvious, entity sets in this context are &quot;Member&quot; and &quot;Book&quot;. \r\nThe entity set &quot;Member&quot; represents all students, professors, or employees who have registered \r\nthemselves with the LIS. While registering with the LIS one has to furnish a lot of personal and professional \r\ninformation. This typically includes name (well, that is trivial), employee ID (roll # for students), email address,\r\nphone #, age, date of joining in this institute. The system may store some not-so-important information\r\nas well like, blood group, marital status, and so on. All these pieces of information that an user has\r\nto provide are sufficient to describe a particular member. These characteristics are the attributes\r\nof the entities belonging to the entity set &quot;Member&quot;.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is essential for an entity to have one or more attributes that help us to distinguish it from another\r\nentity. \'Name\' can\'t help that -- two persons could have exactly the same name. However, (\'Name\', \'Phone #\')\r\ncombination seems to be okay. No two persons can have the same phone number. \'Employee ID\', \'Email address\' \r\nare other potential candidates. Here, \'Employee ID\', \'Email address\' and (\'Name\', \'Phone #\') are super keys.\r\nWe choose \'Employee ID\' to uniquely identify an user in our implementation. So, \'Employee ID\' becomes our\r\nprimary key (PK) for the &quot;Member&quot; entity set. Figure 1 represents this set along with it\'s \r\nattributes and the primary key.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n    <img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/case_study/erd/member.png\" alt=\"Member entity set\" class=\"diagram\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    Figure 1: &quot;Member&quot; entity set\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLet us now focus on the &quot;Book&quot; entity set. Typical attributes of a book are it\'s title, name of\r\nauthor(s), publisher, date of publication, edition, language, ISBN-10, ISBN-13, price (of course!), date of\r\npurchase. The set of listed attributes for a book doesn\'t give a straight forward choice of primary key.\r\nFor instance, several books could have the same title. Again, ISBN numbers for a book are specific to it\'s\r\nedition -- it can\'t distinguish between two books of the same edition. One might be tempted to use a \r\ncombination of (\'Title\', \'Authors\') as a primary key. This has some shortcomings. It is advisable not to\r\nuse texts as a PK. Moreover, the number of authors that a book could have is not fixed, although it is a\r\nsmall, finite number. The rules of normalization (not covered here) would dictate to have a separate field\r\nfor each author like \'Author1\', \'Author2\', and so on. Therefore, we assign an extra attribute, \'ID\', to each\r\nbook as it\'s PK. Different databases available in the market provide mechanisms to generate such an unique\r\nID, and automatically increment it whenever a new new entity is added. In fact, we could assign such an ID to\r\nthe &quot;Member&quot; entity set as well. However, because of availability of the unique \'Employee ID\' field,\r\nwe skipped that. A graphical representation of the &quot;Book&quot; entity set is shown in figure 2.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n    <img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/case_study/erd/book.png\" alt=\"Book entity set\" class=\"diagram\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    Figure 2: &quot;Book&quot; entity set\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne point to note here is that a book is likely to have multiple copies in the library. Therefore, one\r\nmight wish to have a \'# of copies\' attribute for the &quot;Book&quot; entity set. However, that won\'t allow\r\nus to differentiate among the different copies of book bearing same title by same author(s), edition, and \r\npublisher. The approach that we have taken is to uniquely identify each book even though they are copies of\r\nthe same title.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo buy any new book an order is to be placed to the distributor. This task is done by the librarian. Therefore,\r\n&quot;Librarian&quot; and &quot;Distributor&quot; are two other entities playing roles in this system.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHaving identified the key entities, we could now relate them with each other. Let us consider the entity sets &quot;Member&quot;\r\nand &quot;Book&quot;. A member can issue books. In fact, he can issue multiple books up to a finite number\r\nsay, N. A particular book, however, could be issued by a single member only. Therefore, we have a one-to-many mapping\r\nfrom &quot;Member&quot; to &quot;Book&quot; entity sets. This relationship between &quot;Member&quot;\r\nand &quot;Book&quot; entity sets is pictorially depicted in figure 3.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n    <img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/case_study/erd/relationships.png\" alt=\"Relationships among entity set\" class=\"diagram\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    Figure 3: Relationships among different entity sets\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFigure 3 also shows that the librarian can &quot;place order&quot;\r\nfor books to the distributor. This is a many-to-many mapping since a librarian can purchase books from multiple\r\ndistributors. Also, if the institute has more than one librarians (or any other staff having such authority), then \r\neach of them could place order to the same distributor. An order is termed as complete when distributor supplies\r\nthe book(s) and invoice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe design in figure 3 has a flaw. Librarian himself could be a member of the LIS. However, he is a &quot;special&quot;\r\nkind of member since he can place order for books. Our ER diagram doesn\'t reflect this scenario. Such special roles\r\nof an entity set could be represented using &quot;ISA&quot; relationship, which is not discussed here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAny kind of designing couldn\'t be possibly done at one go. Therefore, the baseline ER model so prepared should\r\nbe revised by considering the business model yet again to ensure that all necessary information could be captured.\r\nOnce this has been finalized, the next logical step would be to create table structures for each identified entity \r\nset (and relationships in some cases) and normalize the relations.\r\n</p>\r\n'),(8,10,'A Library Information System for SE VLabs Institute','<p>\r\nThe SE VLabs Institute has been recently setup to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the field of Software Engineering.

It\r\nis desirable (and advisable) to create a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)\r\nshowing a mapping from individual requirement to test case(s). A simplified form of \r\nthe RTM is shown in table 1 (the numbers shown in this table are arbitrary; not specific\r\nto LIS). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<table class=\"techno\">\r\n    <caption>Table 1: A simplified mapping from requirements to test cases</caption>\r\n    <thead>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>Requirement #</th>\r\n            <th>Test Case #</th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </thead>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>R1</td>\r\n            <td>TC1</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>R2</td>\r\n            <td>TC2, TC3, TC4</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>R3</td>\r\n            <td>TC5</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>R4</td>\r\n            <td>TC6</td>\r\n        </tr>        \r\n    </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTable 1 states which test case should help us to verify that a specified feature has been\r\nimplemented and working correctly. For instance, if test case # TC6 fails, that would\r\nindicate requirement # R4 has not fully realized yet. Note that it is possible that a particular \r\nrequirement might need multiple test cases to verify whether it has been implemented correctly.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo be specific to our problem, let us see how we can design test cases to verify the &quot;User\r\nLogin&quot; feature. The simplest scenario is when both user name and password have been\r\ntyped in correctly. The outcome will be that the user could then avail all features of LIS.\r\nHowever, there could be multiple unsuccessful conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>User ID is wrong</li>\r\n    <li>Password is wrong</li>\r\n    <li>User ID & password are wrong</li>\r\n    <li>Wrong password given twice consecutively</li>\r\n    <li>Wrong password given thrice consecutively</li>\r\n    <li>Wrong password given thrice consecutively, and security question answered correctly</li>\r\n    <li>Wrong password given thrice consecutively, and security question answered incorrectly</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe would create test case for the above stated login scenarios.

The CFG has six nodes and seven\r\nedges. So, the Cyclomatic complexity is V(G) = 7 - 6 + 2 = 3.\r\nIt can be verified with the other two formulae as well: # of regions + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. Also, # of decision points = 2. So, V(G) = 2 + 1 = 3. \r\nHowever, as mentioned in the theory section, for methods\r\nof classes we add an extra 1 to the V(G). So, the Cyclomatic complexity of this method becomes 4, which is good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n    <img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/case_study/cfg/reissue_book.png\" alt=\"Reissue book\" class=\"diagram\">\r\n    Figure 1.

Taking this into account, V(G) for the module would\r\nbecome 5, which is OK. This implies that the method could have upto five linearly independent paths. By looking at\r\nfigure 1 we can easily identify three such paths. However, as mentioned that line # 3 consists of two decision points, that\r\nresults in another &quot;implicit&quot; path. Based on these, we can design four test cases that would result in Boolean\r\nvalues for this sequence { user.canIssueNow, Book.IsAvailable, count < REISSUE_LIMIT }. The four such cases are shown below:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>{ true, true, true } : Output should be a valid ID</li>\r\n    <li>{ false, true, true } : Output would be null</li>\r\n    <li>{ true, false, true } : Output would be null</li>\r\n    <li>{ true, true, false } : Output would be null</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow let us focus on the &quot;IssueManager&quot; class.

Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by the institution.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe final deliverable would a web application, which should run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in plain text. \r\n</p>','<p>\r\nFigure 1 shows the context-level DFD for LIS. The entire system is represented with a single circle (process). The external entities interacting with this system are members of LIS, library staff, librarian, and non-members of LIS. Two database are used to keep track of member information and details of books in the library.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLet us focus on the external entity, Member. In order to issue or return books a member has to login to the system. The data flow labeled with &quot;Login credentials&quot; indicate the step when a member authenticates himself by providing required information (user ID, password). The system in turn verifies the user credentials using information stored in the members database. If all information are not provided correctly, the user is shown a login failure message. Otherwise, the user can continue with his operation. Note that a DFD does not show conditional flows. It can only summarize the information flowing in and out of the system.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe data flow with the label &quot;Requested book details&quot; identify the information that the user has to provide in order to issue a book. LIS checks with the books database whether the given book is available. After a book has been issued, the transaction details is provided to the member.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 900px; height: auto; overflow: scroll;\">\r\n    <img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/case_study/dfd/dfd_level0.png\" class=\"diagram\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nFigure 1: Context-level DFD for Library Information System\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe level-1 DFD is shown in figure 2. Here, we split the top-level view of the system into multiple logical components. Each process has a name, and a dotted-decimal number in the form 1.x. For example, the process &quot;Issue book&quot; has the number 1.2, which indicates that in the level 1 DFD the concerned process is numbered 2. Other processes are numbered in a similar way.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 900px; height: auto; overflow: scroll;\">\r\n    <img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/case_study/dfd/dfd_level1.png\" class=\"diagram\">\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nFigure 2: Level 1 DFD for Library Information System\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nComparing figures 1 and 2 one might observe that the information flow in and out of LIS has been preserved. We observe in figure 2 that the sub-processes themselves exchange information among themselves. These information flows would be, in turn, preserved if we decompose the system into a level 2 DFD.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, in order to eliminate intersecting lines and make the DFD complex, the Member external entity has been duplicated in figure 2. This is indicated by a * mark near the right-bottom corner of the entity box.\r\n</p>');

Requirements specify \r\nhow the target system should behave. It specifies what to do, but not how to do. \r\nRequirements engineering refers to the process of understanding what a customer \r\nexpects from the system to be developed, and to document them in a standard and \r\neasily readable and understandable format. This documentation will serve as reference \r\nfor the subsequent design, implementation and verification of the system.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is necessary and important that before we start planning, design and \r\nimplementation of the software system for our client, we are clear about it\'s \r\nrequirements. If we don\'t have a clear vision of what is to be developed and what \r\nall features are expected, there would be serious problems, and customer \r\ndissatisfaction as well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Characteristics of Requirements</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRequirements gathered for any new system to be developed should exhibit the \r\nfollowing three properties:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Unambiguity:</strong> There should not be any ambiguity what a\r\n    system to be developed should do. For example, consider you are developing a web \r\n    application for your client. The client requires that enough number of people \r\n    should be able to access the application simultaneously. What\'s the &quot;enough \r\n    number of people&quot;? That could mean 10 to you, but, perhaps, 100 to the client.\r\n    There\'s an ambiguity.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Consistency:</strong> To illustrate this, consider the automation \r\n    of a nuclear plant. Suppose one of the clients say that it the radiation level \r\n    inside the plant exceeds R1, all reactors should be shut down. However, another\r\n    person from the client side suggests that the threshold radiation level should\r\n    be R2. Thus, there is an inconsistency between the two end users regarding what\r\n    they consider as threshold level of radiation.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Completeness:</strong> A particular requirement for a system \r\n    should specify what the system should do and also what it should not. For \r\n    example, consider a software to be developed for ATM. If a customer enters an \r\n    amount greater than the maximum permissible withdrawal amount, the ATM should \r\n    display an error message, and it should not dispense any cash.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Categorization of Requirements</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBased on the target audience or subject matter, requirements can be classified \r\ninto different types, as stated below:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>User requirements: </strong>They are written in natural language\r\n    so that both customers can verify their requirements have been correctly\r\n    identified\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>System requirements: </strong>They are written involving technical \r\n    terms and/or specifications, and are meant for the development or testing \r\n    teams\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRequirements can be classified into two groups based on what they describe:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Functional requirements (FRs): </strong>These describe the \r\n    functionality of a system -- how a system should react to a particular set \r\n    of inputs and what should be the corresponding output.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Non-functional requirements (NFRs): </strong>They are not directly \r\n    related what functionalities are expected from the system. However, NFRs \r\n    could typically define how the system should behave under certain situations. \r\n    For example, a NFR could say that the system should work with 128MB RAM. \r\n    Under such condition, a NFR could be more critical than a FR.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNon-functional requirements could be further classified into different types \r\nlike:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Product requirements:</strong> For example, a specification that \r\n    the web application should use only plain HTML, and no frames\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Performance requirements:</strong> For example, the system should \r\n    remain available 24x7\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Organizational requirements:</strong> The development process should \r\n    comply to SEI CMM level 4\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identifying Functional Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGiven a problem statement, the functional requirements could be identified by \r\nfocusing on the following points:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Identify the high level functional requirements simply from the conceptual \r\n    understanding of the problem. For example, a Library Management System, apart\r\n    from anything else, should be able to issue and return books.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Identify the cases where an end user gets some meaningful work done by using \r\n    the system. For example, in a digital library a user might use \r\n    the &quot;Search Book&quot; functionality to obtain information about the books of his \r\n    interest.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    If we consider the system as a black box, there would be some inputs to it,\r\n    and some output in return. This black box defines the functionalities of the\r\n    system. For example, to search for a book, user gives title of the book as \r\n    input and get the book details and location as the output.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Any high level requirement identified could have different sub-requirements.\r\n    For example, &quot;Issue Book&quot; module could behave differently for\r\n    different class of users, or for a particular user who has issued the book\r\n    thrice consecutively.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>\r\nPreparing Software Requirements Specifications\r\n</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce all possible FRs and non-FRs have been identified, which are complete, \r\nconsistent, and non-ambiguous, the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is \r\nto be prepared. IEEE provides a template  \r\n<a href=&quot;/isad/isad/1/references/&quot;>[iv]</a>, also available \r\n<a href=&quot;http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse870/IEEEXplore-SRS-template.pdf&quot;>\r\nhere</a>, which could be used for this purpose. The SRS is prepared by the \r\nservice provider, and verified by its client. This document serves as a legal \r\nagreement between the client and the service provider. Once the concerned system \r\nhas been developed and deployed, and a proposed feature was not found to be \r\npresent in the system, the client can point this out from the SRS. Also, if after \r\ndelivery, the client says a new feature is required, which was not mentioned in \r\nthe SRS, the service provider can again point to the SRS. The scope of the \r\ncurrent experiment, however, doesn\'t cover writing a SRS.\r\n</p>','<ul>\r\n<li>Identify ambiguities, inconsistencies and incompleteness from a requirements specification</li>\r\n<li>Identify and state functional requirements</li>\r\n<li>Identify and state non-functional requirements</li>\r\n</ul>','3.00','<p>\r\nRequirements identification is the first step of any software development project.  Until the requirements of a client have been clearly identified, and verified, no other task (design, coding, testing) could begin. Usually business analysts having domain knowledge on the subject matter discuss with clients and decide what features are to be implemented.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this experiment we will learn how to identify functional and non-functional requirements from a given problem statement. Functional and non-functional requirements are the primary components of a Software Requirements Specification.\r\n</p>'),(2,'Estimation of Project Metrics','<h2>Project Estimation Techniques</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA software project is not just about writing a few hundred lines of source code \r\nto achieve a particular objective. The scope of a software project is \r\ncomparatively <i>quite large</i>, and such a project could take several years to \r\ncomplete. However, the phrase &quot;quite large&quot; could only give some \r\n(possibly vague) qualitative information. As in any other science and engineering\r\ndiscipline, one would be interested to <i>measure</i> how complex a project is. \r\nOne of the major activities of the project planning phase, therefore, is to \r\nestimate various project parameters in order to take proper \r\ndecisions. Some important project parameters that are estimated include: \r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Project size:</strong> What would be the size of the code written \r\n    say, in number of lines, files, modules?\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Cost:</strong> How much would it cost to develop a software? A\r\n    software may be just pieces of code, but one has to pay to the managers,\r\n    developers, and other project personnel.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Duration:</strong> How long would it be before the software is\r\n    delivered to the clients?\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Effort:</strong> How much effort from the team members would be \r\n    required to create the software?\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this experiment we will focus on two methods for estimating project metrics: \r\nCOCOMO and Halstead\'s method.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>COCOMO</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCOCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) was proposed by Boehm. According to him, there \r\ncould be three categories of software projects: organic, semidetached, and \r\nembedded. The classification \r\nis done considering the characteristics of the software, the development team and \r\nenvironment. These product classes typically correspond to application, utility\r\nand system programs, respectively. Data processing programs could be considered \r\nas application programs. Compilers, linkers, are examples of utility programs. \r\nOperating systems, real-time system programs are examples of system programs. \r\nOne could easily apprehend that it would take much more time and effort to\r\ndevelop an OS than an attendance management system.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe concept of organic, semidetached, and embedded systems are described below.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Organic:</strong> A development project is said to be of organic type, \r\nif \r\n  <ul style=\"font-size: 0.9em;\">\r\n    <li>The project deals with developing a well understood application</li>\r\n    <li>The development team is small</li>\r\n    <li>The team members have prior experience in working with similar types of \r\n    projects</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Semidetached:</strong> A development project can be categorized as \r\nsemidetached type, if \r\n  <ul style=\"font-size: 0.9em;\">\r\n    <li>The team consists of some experienced as well as inexperienced \r\n    staff</li>\r\n    <li>Team members may have some experience on the type of system to be \r\n    developed</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Embedded:</strong> Embedded type of development project are those, which\r\n  <ul style=\"font-size: 0.9em;\">\r\n    <li>Aims to develop a software strongly related to machine hardware</li>\r\n    <li>Team size is usually large</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>                                                    \r\nBoehm suggested that estimation of project parameters should be done through\r\nthree stages: Basic COCOMO, Intermediate COCOMO, and Complete COCOMO.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Basic COCOMO Model</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThe basic COCOMO model helps to obtain a rough estimate of the project\r\nparameters. It estimates effort and time required for development in the \r\nfollowing way: \r\n<br>\r\n                              \r\n  <span class=\"contentEquation\">Effort = a * (KDSI)<sup>b</sup> PM </span>                                                 \r\n  <span class=\"contentEquation\">Tdev = 2.5 * (Effort)<sup>c</sup> Months </span> \r\n                       \r\nwhere\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>KDSI is the estimated size of the software expressed in Kilo Delivered \r\n  Source Instructions</li>\r\n  <li>a, b, c are constants determined by the category of software project</li>\r\n  <li>Effort denotes the total effort required for the software development, \r\n  expressed in person months (PMs)</li>\r\n  <li>Tdev denotes the estimated time required to develop the software \r\n  (expressed in months)</li>  \r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe value of the constants a, b, c are given below: <br> <br>\r\n<table class=\"data\">\r\n<thead><tr>\r\n<th>Software project</th>\r\n<th><i>a</i></th>\r\n<th><i>b</i></th>\r\n<th><i>c</i></th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Organic</td>\r\n<td>2.4</td>\r\n<td>1.05</td>\r\n<td>0.38</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Semi-detached</td>\r\n<td>3.0</td>\r\n<td>1.12</td>\r\n<td>0.35</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Embedded</td>\r\n<td>3.6</td>\r\n<td>1.20</td>\r\n<td>0.32</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Intermediate COCOMO Model</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe basic COCOMO model considers that effort and development time depends only \r\non the size of the software. However, in real life there are many other project \r\nparameters that influence the development process. The intermediate COCOMO take \r\nthose other factors into consideration by defining a\r\nset of 15 cost drivers (multipliers) as shown in the table below <a \r\nhref=\"/isad/isad/2/references/\">[i]</a>. Thus, any project that makes use of \r\nmodern programming practices would have lower estimates in terms of effort and \r\ncost. Each of the 15 such attributes can be rated on a six-point scale ranging \r\nfrom \"very low\" to \"extra high\" in their relative order of importance. Each \r\nattribute has an effort multiplier fixed as per the rating. The product of effort \r\nmultipliers of all the 15 attributes gives the <strong>Effort Adjustment Factor \r\n(EAF)</strong>. \r\n\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"data\" cellpadding=\"0\"

class=\"contentEquation\">Effort|<sub>corrected</sub> = Effort * EAF</span>\r\n<span class=\"contentEquation\">Tdev|<sub>corrected</sub> = 2.5 * (Effort|<sub>\r\ncorrected</sub>) <sup>c</sup></span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Complete COCOMO Model</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBoth the basic and intermediate COCOMO models consider a software to be a single \r\nhomogeneous entity -- an assumption, which is rarely true. In fact, many real \r\nlife applications are made up of several smaller sub-systems. (One might not\r\neven develop all the sub-systems -- just use the available services). The complete \r\nCOCOMO model takes these factors into account to provide a far more accurate \r\nestimate of project metrics.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo illustrate this, consider a very popular distributed application: the ticket\r\nbooking system of the Indian Railways. There are computerized ticket counters in \r\nmost of the railway stations of our country. Tickets can be booked / cancelled \r\nfrom any such counter. Reservations for future tickets, cancellation of reserved\r\ntickets could also be performed. On a high level, the ticket booking system has \r\nthree main components:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Database</li>\r\n  <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</li>\r\n  <li>Networking facilities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAmong these, development of the GUI is considered as an organic project type; the \r\ndatabase module could be considered as a semi-detached software. The networking \r\nmodule can be considered as an embedded software. To obtain a realistic cost,\r\none should estimate the costs for each component separately, and then add it up.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Advantages of COCOMO</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCOCOMO is a simple model, and should help one to understand the concept of \r\nproject metrics estimation. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Drawbacks of COCOMO</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCOCOMO uses KDSI, which is not a proper measure of a program\'s size. Indeed, \r\nestimating the size of a software is a difficult task, and any slight \r\nmiscalculation could cause a large deviation in subsequent project estimates. \r\nMoreover, COCOMO was proposed in 1981 keeping the waterfall model of project life \r\ncycle in mind <a href=\"/2/references/\">[2]</a>. It fails to \r\naddress other popular approaches like prototype, incremental, spiral, agile models. \r\nMoreover, in present day a software project may not necessarily consist of \r\ncoding of every bit of functionality. Rather, existing software components are\r\noften used and glued together towards the development of a new software. COCOMO \r\nis not suitable in such cases.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCOCOMO II was proposed later in 2000 to many of address these issues.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Halstead\'s Complexity Metrics</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHalstead took a linguistic approach to determine the complexity of a program. \r\nAccording to him, a computer program consists of a collection of different \r\noperands and operators. The definition of operands and operators could, however,\r\nvary from one person to another and one programming language to other. Operands \r\nare usually the implementation variables or constants -- something upon which an \r\noperation could be performed. Operators are those symbols that affects the value \r\nof operands. Halstead\'s metrics are computed based on the operators and operands \r\nused in a computer program. Any given program has the following four parameters:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>n1</strong>: Number of unique operators used in the program</li>\r\n<li><strong>n2</strong>: Number of unique operands used in the program</li>\r\n<li><strong>N1</strong>: Total number of operators used in the program</li>\r\n<li><strong>N2</strong>: Total number of operands used in the program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nUsing the above parameters one compute the following metrics:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Program Length</strong>: N = N1 + N2</li>\r\n<li><strong>Program Vocabulary</strong>: n = n1 + n2</li>\r\n<li><strong>Volume</strong>: V = N * lg n</li>\r\n<li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: D = (n1 * N2) / (2 * n2)</li>\r\n<li><strong>Effort</strong>: E = D * V</li>\r\n<li><strong>Time to Implement</strong>: T = E / 18 (in seconds) \r\n<a href=\"/2/references/\">[vi]</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe program volume V is the minimum number of bits needed to encode the program. \r\nIt represents the size of the program while taking into account the programming \r\nlanguage. \r\n<br>\r\nThe difficulty metric indicates how difficult a program is to write or \r\nunderstand. \r\n<br>\r\nEffort denotes the \"mental effort\" required to develop the software, or to recreate the same in another programming language\r\n<a href=\"/2/references/\">[iv]</a>.\r\n</p>','<ul>\r\n  <li>Categorize projects using COCOMO, and estimate effort and development time required for a project</li>\r\n  <li>Estimate the program complexity and effort required to recreate it using Halstead\'s metrics</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n','3.00','<p>After gathering the entire requirements specific to software project usually we need to think about different solution strategy for the project.

It consists of a set of actions (referred to as use \r\ncases) that the concerned system can perform, one or more actors, and \r\ndependencies among them. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Actor</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAn actor can be defined as <a href=\"/isad/isad/3/references/\">[1]</a> an object \r\nor set of objects, external to the system, which interacts with the system to \r\nget some meaningful work done. Actors could be human, devices, or even\r\nother systems.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor example, consider the case where a customer <em>withdraws cash</em> from an \r\nATM. Here, customer is a human actor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nActors can be classified as below <a href=\"/isad/isad/3/references/\">[2], [i]\r\n</a>:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Primary actor</strong>: They are principal users of the system, who\r\n    fulfill their goal by availing some service from the system. For example, a \r\n    customer uses an ATM to withdraw cash when he needs it. A customer is the \r\n    primary actor here.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Supporting actor</strong>: They render some kind of service to the \r\n    system. \"Bank representatives\", who replenishes the stock of cash, is such \r\n    an example. It may be noted that replenishing stock of cash in an ATM is not \r\n    the prime functionality of an ATM.\r\n    </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>    \r\nIn a use case diagram primary actors are usually drawn on the top left side of \r\nthe diagram.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Use Case</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nA use case is simply <a href=\"/isad/isad/3/references/\">[1]</a> a \r\nfunctionality provided by a system.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nContinuing with the example of the ATM, <em>withdraw cash</em> is a \r\nfunctionality that the ATM provides. Therefore, this is a use case. Other \r\npossible use cases includes, <em>check balance</em>, <em>change PIN</em>, \r\nand so on. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUse cases include both successful and unsuccessful scenarios of user \r\ninteractions with the system. For example, authentication of a customer by the \r\nATM would fail if he enters wrong PIN. In such case, an error message is \r\ndisplayed on the screen of the ATM.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Subject</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nSubject is simply <a href=\"/isad/isad/3/references/\">[iii]</a> the \r\nsystem under consideration. Use cases apply to a subject. For example, an ATM\r\nis a subject, having multiple use cases, and multiple actors interact with it.\r\nHowever, one should be careful of external systems interacting with the subject\r\nas actors.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Graphical Representation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAn actor is represented by a stick figure and name of the actor is written below \r\nit. A use case is depicted by an ellipse and name of the use case is written \r\ninside it. The subject is shown by drawing a rectangle. Label for the \r\nsystem could be put inside it. Use cases are drawn inside the rectangle, and \r\nactors are drawn outside the rectangle, as shown in figure - 01.\r\n\r\n    <img class=\"diagram\" alt=\"Use case diagram\" style=\"display: block;\"\r\n    src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/03/use_case_1.png\">\r\nFigure - 01: A use case diagram for a book store\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Association between Actors and Use Cases</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA use case is triggered by an actor. Actors and use cases are connected through \r\nbinary associations indicating that the two communicates through message passing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn actor must be associated with at least one use case. Similarly, a given use \r\ncase must be associated with at least one actor. Association among the actors \r\nare usually not shown. However, one can depict the class hierarchy among actors.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Use Case Relationships</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThree types of relationships exist among use cases:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Include relationship</li>\r\n    <li>Extend relationship</li>\r\n    <li>Use case generalization</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Include Relationship</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInclude relationships are used to depict common behaviour that are shared by \r\nmultiple use cases. This could be considered analogous to writing functions in a \r\nprogram in order to avoid repetition of writing the same code. Such a function \r\nwould be called from different points within the program.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Example</h4>\r\n<p>\r\nFor example, consider an email application. A user can send a new mail, reply to \r\nan email he has received, or forward an email. However, in each of these three \r\ncases, the user must be logged in to perform those actions. Thus, we could have \r\na <em>login</em> use case, which is included by <em>compose mail</em>, \r\n<em>reply</em>, and <em>forward email</em> use cases. The relationship is shown \r\nin figure - 02.\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n    <img class=\"diagram\" alt=\"Include relationship\" \r\n    src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/03/use_case_include.png\">\r\nFigure - 02: Include relationship between use cases\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Notation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInclude relationship is depicted by a dashed arrow with a &laquo;include&raquo; \r\nstereotype from the including use case to the included use case.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Extend Relationship</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUse case extensions are used used to depict any variation to an existing use \r\ncase. They are used to the specify the changes required when any assumption made\r\nby the existing use case becomes false <a href=\"/3/references/\">\r\n[iv, v]</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Example</h4>\r\n<p>\r\nLet\'s consider an online bookstore. The system allows an authenticated user to \r\nbuy selected book(s). While the order is being placed, the system also allows to  \r\nspecify any special shipping instructions \r\n<a href=\"/3/references/\">[vii]</a>, for example, call the \r\ncustomer before delivery. This <em>Shipping Instructions</em> step is optional, \r\nand not a part of the main <em>Place Order</em> use case. Figure - 03 depicts \r\nsuch relationship.\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n    <img class=\"diagram\" alt=\"Extend relationship\" \r\n    src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/03/use.png\">\r\nFigure - 03: Extend relationship between use cases\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Notation</h4>\r\n<p>\r\nExtend relationship is depicted by a dashed arrow with a &laquo;extend&raquo; \r\nstereotype from the extending use case to the extended use case.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Generalization Relationship</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGeneralization relationship are used to represent the inheritance between use \r\ncases. A derived use case specializes some functionality it has already \r\ninherited from the base use case.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Example</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo illustrate this, consider a graphical application that allows users to draw \r\npolygons. We could have a use case <em>draw polygon</em>. Now, rectangle is a \r\nparticular instance of polygon having four sides at right angles to each other. \r\nSo, the use case <em>draw rectangle</em> inherits the properties of the use case \r\n<em>draw polygon</em> and overrides it\'s drawing method.

In ER model, real world objects (or concepts) are abstracted as \r\nentities, and different possible associations among them are modeled as \r\nrelationships.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor example, student and school -- they are two entities. Students study in \r\nschool. So, these two entities are associated with a relationship \"Studies in\".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs another example, consider a system where some job runs every night, which \r\nupdates the database. Here, job and database could be two entities. They are \r\nassociated with the relationship \"Updates\".\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Entity Set and Relationship Set</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAn entity set is a collection of all similar entities. For example, \"Student\" is\r\n an entity set that abstracts all students. Ram, John are specific entities \r\nbelonging to this set. Similarly, a \"Relationship\" set is a set of similar \r\nrelationships.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Attributes of Entity</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAttributes are the characteristics describing any entity belonging to an entity \r\nset. Any entity in a set can be described by zero or more attributes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor example, any student has got a name, age, an address. At any given time a \r\nstudent can study only at one school. In the school he would have a roll number, \r\nand of course a grade in which he studies. These data are the attributes of \r\nthe entity set Student. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Keys</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne or more attribute(s) of an entity set can be used to define the following \r\nkeys:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Super key:</strong> One or more attributes, which when taken \r\n    together, helps to uniquely identify an entity in an entity set. For \r\n    example, a school can have any number of students. However, if we know grade \r\n    and roll number, then we can uniquely identify a student in that school.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Candidate key:</strong> It is a minimal subset of a super key. In \r\n    other words, a super key might contain extraneous attributes, which do not\r\n    help in identifying an object uniquely. When such attributes are removed, \r\n    the key formed so is called a candidate key.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Primary key:</strong> A database might have more than one\r\n    candidate key. Any candidate key chosen for a particular implementation of \r\n    the database is called a primary key.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Prime attribute:</strong> Any attribute taking part in a super \r\n    key\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Weak Entity</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAn entity set is said to be weak if it is dependent upon another entity set. A \r\nweak entity can\'t be uniquely identified only by it\'s attributes. In other \r\nwords, it doesn\'t have a super key.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor example, consider a company that allows employees to have travel allowance\r\nfor their immediate family. So, here we have two entity sets: employee and \r\nfamily, related by \"Can claim for\". However, family doesn\'t have a super key. \r\nExistence of a family is entirely dependent on the concerned employee. So, it \r\nis meaningful only with reference to employee.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Entity Generalization and Specialization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnce we have identified the entity sets, we might find some similarities among \r\nthem. For example, multiple person interacts with a banking system. Most of them \r\nare customers, and rest employees or other service providers. Here, customers, \r\nemployees are persons, but with certain specializations. Or in other way, person \r\nis the generalized form of customer and employee entity sets.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nER model uses the \"ISA\" hierarchy to depict specialization (and thus, \r\ngeneralization).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Mapping Cardinalities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the main tasks of ER modeling is to associate different entity sets. \r\nLet\'s consider two entity sets E1 and E2 associated by a relationship set R. \r\nBased on the number of entities in E1 and E2 are associated with, we can have \r\nthe following four type of mappings:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>One to one:</strong> An entity in E1 is related to at most a single\r\n    entity in E2, and vice versa\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>One to many:</strong> An entity in E1 could be related to zero or \r\n    more entities in E2. Any entity in E2 could be related to at most a single \r\n    entity in E1.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Many to one:</strong> Zero or more number of entities in E1 could be \r\n    associated to a single entity in E2. However, an entity in E2 could be \r\n    related to at most one entity in E1.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Many to many:</strong> Any number of entities could be related to \r\n    any number of entities in E2, including zero, and vice versa.\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	\r\n<h2>ER Diagram</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom a given problem statement we identify the possible entity sets, their \r\nattributes, and relationships among different entity sets. Once we have these \r\ninformation, we represent them pictorially, called an entity-relationship (ER) \r\ndiagram.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Graphical Notations for ER Diagram</h2>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<table class=\"techno\" style=\"width: 800px;\">\r\n<thead>\r\n  <tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n    <th>Term</th>\r\n    <th>Notation</th>\r\n    <th>Remarks</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n\r\n<tbody style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Entity set</td>\r\n    <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/04/entity.png\" alt=\"Entity\" >\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>\r\n    Name of the set is written inside the rectangle\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Attribute</td>\r\n    <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/04/attribute.png\" alt=\"Attribute\" >\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>\r\n    Name of the attribute is written inside the ellipse\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Entity with attributes</td>\r\n    <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/04/entity_attributes.png\" \r\n    alt=\"Entity with attributes\">\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>Roll is the primary key; denoted with an underline</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Weak entity set</td>\r\n    <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/04/weak_entity.png\" \r\n    alt=\"Weak entity\" >\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Relationship set</td>\r\n    <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/04/relationship.png\" \r\n    alt=\"Relationship\" >\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>\r\n    Name of the relationship is written inside the diamond\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Related enity sets</td>\r\n    <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/04/entity_relationship.png\" \r\n    alt=\"Entity relationship\" >\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Relationship cardinality</td>\r\n    <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/04/relationship_cardinality.png\" \r\n    alt=\"Relationship cardinality\" >\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>A person can own zero or more cars but no two persons can own the same \r\n    car</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Relationship with weak entity set</td>\r\n    <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/04/weak_entity_relationship.png\" \r\n    alt=\"Weak entity relationship\" >\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Importance of ER modeling</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFigure - 01 shows the different steps involved in implementation of a \r\n(relational) database.\r\n<br>\r\n<center>\r\n<img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/04/database_design_steps.png\" id=\"diagram\" \r\nalt=\"Database design steps\" >\r\nFigure - 01: Steps to implement a RDBMS\r\n</center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGiven a problem statement, the first step is to identify the entities, \r\nattributes and relationships.

Domain Model, as a conceptual model gives proper understanding of problem description through its highly effective component – the Domain Classes. Domain classes are the abstraction of key entities, concepts or ideas presented in the problem statement <a href=\"/isad/isad/5/references/\">[iv]</a>. As stated in <a href=\"/isad/isad/5/references/\">[v]</a>, domain classes are used for representing business activities during the analysis phase. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBelow we discuss some techniques that can be used to identify the domain classes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Traditional Techniques for Identification of Classes</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Grammatical Approach Using Nouns</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThis object identification technique was proposed by Russell J. Abbot, and Grady Booch made the technique popular <a href=\"/isad/isad/5/references/\">[1]</a>. This technique involves grammatical analysis of the problem statement to identify list of potential classes. The logical steps are:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Obtain the user requirements (problem statement) as a simple, descriptive English text. This basically corresponds to the use-case diagram for the problem statement. </li>\r\n<li>Identify and mark the nouns, pronouns and noun phrases from the above problem statements</li>\r\n<li>List of potential classes is obtained based on the category of the nouns (details given later). For example, nouns that direct refer to any person, place, or entity in general, correspond to different objects. And so does singular proper nouns.  On the other hand, plural nouns and common nouns are candidates that usually map into classes. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is one of the simplest approaches that could be easily understood and applied by a larger section of the user base. The problem statement does not necessarily be in English, but in any other language.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Disadvantages</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThe problem statement always may not help towards correct identification of a class. At times it could give us redundant classes. At times the problem statement may use abbreviations for large systems or concepts, and therefore, the identified class may actually point to an aggregate of classes. In other words, it may not find all the objects.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Using Generalization</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this approach, all potential objects are classified into different groups based on some common behaviour. Classes are derived from these groups.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Using Subclasses</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nHere, instead of identifying objects one goes for identification of classes based on some similar characteristics. These are the specialized classes. Common characteristics are taken from them to form the higher level generalized classes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Steps to Identify Domain Classes from Problem Statement</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe now present the steps to identify domain classes from a given problem statement. This approach is mostly based on the “Grammatical approach using nouns” discussed above, with some insights from <a href=\"isad/isad/5/references/\">[i]</a>.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Make a list of potential objects by finding out the nouns and noun phrases from narrative problem statement</li>\r\n<li>Apply subject matter expertise (or domain knowledge) to identify additional classes</li>\r\n<li>Filter out the redundant or irrelevant classes</li>\r\n<li>Classify all potential objects based on categories.

While grouping we should remember that\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Different nouns (or noun phrases) can actually refer to the same thing (examples: house, home, abode) </li>\r\n<li>Same nouns (or noun phrases) could refer to different things or concepts (example: I go to school every day / This school of thought agrees with the theory) </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Give related names to each group to generate the final list of top level classes</li>\r\n<li>Iterate over to refine the list of classes</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Advanced Concepts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIdentification of domain classes might not be a simple task for novices. It requires expertise and domain knowledge\r\nto identify business classes from plain English text. The concepts presented here have been kept simple in order to\r\nmake a student familiarize with the subject.

A \r\n<em>statechart diagram</em> is a pictorial representation of such a system, with \r\nall it\'s states, and different events that lead transition from one state to \r\nanother.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo illustrate this, consider a computer. Some possible states that it could have \r\nare: running, shutdown, hibernate. A transition from running state to shutdown \r\nstate occur when user presses the \"Power off\" switch, or clicks on the \r\n\"Shut down\" button as displayed by the OS. Here, clicking on the shutdown \r\nbutton, or pressing the power off switch act as external events causing the \r\ntransition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStatechart diagrams are normally drawn to model the behaviour of a complex \r\nsystem. For simple systems this is optional.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Building Blocks of a Statechart Diagram</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>State</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA state is any \"distinct\" stage that an object (system) passes through in it\'s \r\nlifetime. An object remains in a given state for finite time until \"something\" \r\nhappens, which makes it to move to another state.&nbsp; All such states can be \r\nbroadly categorized into following three types:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Initial</strong>: The state in which an object remain when created\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Final</strong>: The state from which an object do not move to any \r\n    other state [optional]\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Intermediate</strong>: Any state, which is neither initial, nor \r\n    final\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs shown in figure-01, an initial state is represented by a circle filled with \r\nblack. An intermediate state is depicted by a rectangle with rounded corners. A \r\nfinal state is represented by a unfilled circle with an inner black-filled \r\ncircle.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"diagram\" src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/states_symbol.png\" \r\nalt=\"State\"> \r\n<span class=\"diagram-label\">\r\nFigure-01: Representation of initial, intermediate, \r\nand final states of a statechart diagram\r\n</span>\r\n\r\nIntermediate states usually have two compartments, separated by a horizontal \r\nline, called the name compartment and internal transitions compartment \r\n<a href=\"/isad/isad/6/references/\">[iv]</a>. They are described below:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Name compartment</strong>: Contains the name of the state, which is \r\n    a short, simple, descriptive string\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <strong>Internal transitions compartment</strong>: Contains a list of \r\n    internal activities performed as long as the system is in this state\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe internal activities are indicated using the following syntax: \r\n<span class=\"syntax\">action-label / action-expression</span>. Action labels \r\ncould be any condition indicator. There are, however, four special action \r\nlabels:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Entry</strong>: Indicates activity performed when the system \r\n    enter this state</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Exit</strong>: Indicates activity performed when the system \r\n    exits this state</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Do</strong>: indicate any activity that is performed while the \r\n    system remain in this state or until the action expression results in a \r\n    completed computation</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Include</strong>: Indicates invocation of a sub-machine</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAny other action label identify the event (internal transition) as a result of \r\nwhich the corresponding action is triggered. Internal transition is almost \r\nsimilar to self transition, except that the former doesn\'t result in execution \r\nof entry and exit actions. That is, system doesn\'t exit or re-enter that state. \r\nFigure-02 shows the syntax for representing a typical (intermediate) state\r\n\r\n<img class=\"diagram\" src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/state.png\" alt=\"State\">\r\n<span class=\"diagram-label\">\r\nFigure-02: A typical state in a statechart diagram\r\n</span>\r\n\r\nStates could again be either simple or composite (a state congaing other \r\nstates). Here, however, we will deal only with simple states.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTransition is movement from one state to another state in response to an \r\nexternal stimulus (or any internal event). A transition is represented by a \r\nsolid arrow from the current state to the next state. It is labeled by: \r\n<span class=\"syntax\">event [guard-condition]/[action-expression]</span>, where\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Event</strong> is the what is causing the concerned transition \r\n    (mandatory) -- Written in past tense <a href=\"/isad/isad/6/references/\">\r\n    [iii]</a></li>\r\n    <li><strong>Guard-condition</strong> is (are) precondition(s), which must be \r\n    true for the transition to happen [optional]</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Action-expression</strong> indicate action(s) to be performed as \r\n    a result of the transition [optional]</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt may be noted that if a transition is triggered with one or more \r\nguard-condition(s), which evaluate to false, the system will continue to stay in \r\nthe present state. Also, not all transitions do result in a state change. For \r\nexample, if a queue is full, any further attempt to append will fail until the \r\ndelete method is invoked at least once.

While the system is performing any action for the \r\ncurrent event, it doesn\'t accept or process any new event. The order in which \r\ndifferent actions are executed, is given below:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Exit actions of the present state</li>\r\n    <li>Actions specified for the transition</li>\r\n    <li>Entry actions of the next state</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFigure-03 shows a typical statechart diagram with all it\'s syntaxes.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"diagram\" src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/state_transition.png\" \r\nalt=\"State transition\"> \r\n<span class=\"diagram-label\">\r\nFigure-03: A statechart diagram showing transition from state A to B\r\n</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Guidelines for drawing Statechart Diagrams</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFollowing steps could be followed, as suggested in \r\n<a href=\"/isad/isad/6/references/\">[i]</a> to draw a statechart diagram:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>For the system to developed, identify the distinct states that it passes \r\n    through</li>\r\n    <li>Identify the events (and any precondition) that cause the state \r\n    transitions.

It is a high level diagram used to visually represent the \r\nflow of control in a system. It has similarities with traditional flow charts. \r\nHowever, it is more powerful than a simple flow chart since it can represent \r\nvarious other concepts like concurrent activities, their joining, and so on \r\n<a href=\"/isad/isad/6/references/\">[vii, viii]</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nActivity diagrams, however, cannot depict the message passing among related \r\nobjects. As such, it can\'t be directly translated into code. These kind of \r\ndiagrams are suitable for confirming the logic to be implemented with the \r\nbusiness users. These diagrams are typically used when the business logic is \r\ncomplex. In simple scenarios it can be avoided entirely \r\n<a href=\"/isad/isad/6/references/\">[ix]</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Components of an Activity Diagram</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBelow we describe the building blocks of an activity diagram.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Activity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAn activity denotes a particular action taken in the logical flow of control. \r\nThis could simply be invocation of a mathematical function, alter an object\'s \r\nproperties and so on <a href=\"/isad/isad/6/references/\">[x]</a>. An activity is \r\nrepresented with a rounded rectangle, as shown in table-01. A label inside the \r\nrectangle identifies the corresponding activity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are two special type of activity nodes: initial and final. They are \r\nrepresented with a filled circle, and a filled in circle with a border \r\nrespectively (table-01). Initial node represents the starting point of a flow in \r\nan activity diagram. There could be multiple initial nodes, which means that \r\ninvoking that particular activity diagram would initiate multiple flows.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA final node represents the end point of all activities. Like an initial node, \r\nthere could be multiple final nodes. Any transition reaching a final node would \r\nstop all activities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Flow</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA flow (also termed as edge, or transition) is represented with a directed \r\narrow. This is used to depict transfer of control from one activity to another, \r\nor to other types of components, as we will see below. A flow is often \r\naccompanied with a label, called the guard condition, indicating the necessary \r\ncondition for the transition to happen. The syntax to depict it is \r\n<span class=\"syntax\">[guard condition]</span>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Decision</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA decision node, represented with a diamond, is a point where a single flow \r\nenters and two or more flows leave. The control flow can follow only one of the \r\noutgoing paths. The outgoing edges often have guard conditions indicating \r\ntrue-false or if-then-else conditions. However, they can be omitted in obvious \r\ncases. The input edge could also have guard conditions. Alternately, a note can \r\nbe attached to the decision node indicating the condition to be tested.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Merge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is represented with a diamond shape, with two or more flows entering, and a \r\nsingle flow leaving out. A merge node represents the point where at least a \r\nsingle control should reach before further processing could continue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fork</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFork is a point where parallel activities begin. For example, when a student \r\nhas been registered with a college, he can in parallel apply for student ID card \r\nand library card. A fork is graphically depicted with a black bar, with a single \r\nflow entering and multiple flows leaving out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Join</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA join is depicted with a black bar, with multiple input flows, but a single \r\noutput flow. Physically it represents the synchronization of all concurrent \r\nactivities. Unlike a merge, in case of a join all of the incoming controls \r\n<strong>must be completed</strong> before any further progress could be made. \r\nFor example, a sales order is closed only when the customer has receive the \r\nproduct, <strong>and</strong> the sales company has received it\'s payment.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Note</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUML allows attaching a note to different components of a diagram to present some \r\ntextual information. The information could simply be a comment or may be some \r\nconstraint. A note can be attached to a decision point, for example, to indicate \r\nthe branching criteria.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Partition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDifferent components of an activity diagram can be logically grouped into \r\ndifferent areas, called partitions or swimlanes. They often correspond to \r\ndifferent units of an organization or different actors. The drawing area can be \r\npartitioned into multiple compartments using vertical (or horizontal) parallel \r\nlines. Partitions in an activity diagram are not mandatory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe following table shows commonly used components with a typical activity \r\ndiagram.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table class=\"techno\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; width: 400px; text-align: center;\"> \r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>Component</td>\r\n      <th>Graphical Notation</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </thead>\r\n\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Activity</td>\r\n        <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/activity/activity.png\" alt=\"Activity\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Flow</td>\r\n        <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/activity/flow.png\" alt=\"Flow\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Decision</td>\r\n        <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/activity/decision.png\" alt=\"Decision\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Merge</td>\r\n        <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/activity/merge.png\" alt=\"Merge\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Fork</td>\r\n        <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/activity/fork.png\" alt=\"Fork\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Join</td>\r\n        <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/activity/join.png\" alt=\"Join\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Note</td>\r\n        <td><img src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/06/activity/note.png\" alt=\"Note\"></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"diagram-label\">\r\nTable-01: Typical components used in an activity diagram\r\n</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nApart from the above stated components, there are few other components as well \r\n(representing events, sending of signals, nested activity diagrams), which won\'t \r\nbe discussed here.

Association may be uni-directional. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\r\n<p>In structure model for a system of an organization an employee (instance of ‘Employee’ class) is always assigned to a particular department (instance of ‘Department’ class) and the association can be shown by a line connecting the respective classes.<center><img class=\"diagram\" src=\"_STATIC_URL_isad/images/theory/07/exp73.jpg\" alt=\"State\"> Figure-03: </center></p>\r\n<li><strong>Aggregation</strong></li>\r\n<p>It is a special form of association which describes a part-whole<a href=\"/isad/isad/7/references/\">[i]</a>  relationship between a pair of classes.

We may have a test suite of all possible test cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Types of Software Testing</h2>\r\n<p>Testing is done in every stage of software development life cycle, but the testing done at each level of software  development is different in nature and has different objectives. There are different types of testing, such as stress testing, volume testing, configuration testing, compatibility testing, recovery testing, maintenance testing, documentation testing, and usability testing. Software testing are mainlyof following types <a href=\"/isad/isad/10/references/\">[1]</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><ol><li><strong>Unit Testing</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Integration Testing</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>System Testing</strong></li>\r\n</ol></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Unit Testing</h3>\r\n<p>Unit testing is done at the lowest level. It tests the basic unit of software, that is the smallest  testable piece of software. The individual component or unit of a program are tested in unit testing. Unit testing are of two types.\r\n<ul><li><strong>Black box testing</strong>: This is also known as <strong>functional testing</strong> , where the test cases are designed based on input output values only. \r\nThere are many types of Black Box Testing but following are the prominent ones.</li></ul></p>\r\n<p>- <strong> Equivalence class partitioning</strong>: In this approach, the domain of input values to a program is divided into a set of equivalence classes.\r\ne.g. Consider a software program that computes whether an integer number is  even or not that is in the range of 0 to 10. Determine the equivalence class test suite.\r\nThere are three equivalence classes for this program.\r\n- The set of negative integer\r\n- The integers in the range 0 to 10\r\n- The integer larger than 10</p>\r\n<p>- <strong> Boundary value analysis </strong>: In this approach, while designing the test cases, the values at boundaries of different equivalence classes are taken into consideration.\r\ne.g. In the above given example as in equivalence class partitioning, a boundary values based test suite is { 0, -1, 10, 11 }\r\n</p>\r\n<p><ul><li><strong>White box testing</strong>: It is also known as <strong>structural testing</strong>. In this testing, test cases are designed on the basis of examination of the code.This testing is performed based on the knowledge of how the system is implemented. It includes analyzing data flow, control flow, information flow, coding practices, exception and error handling within the system, to test the intended and unintended software behavior. White box testing can be performed to validate whether code implementation follows intended design, to validate implemented security functionality, and to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities.This testing requires access to the source code. Though white box testing can be performed any time in the life cycle after the code is developed, but it is a good practice to perform white box testing during the unit testing phase. </li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Integration Testing</h3>\r\n<p>Integration testing is performed when two or more tested units are combined into a larger structure. The main objective of this testing is to check whether the different modules of a program interface with each other properly or not. This testing is mainly of two types:</p> <p><ul> <li><strong> Top-down approach</strong></li><li><strong>Bottom-up approach</strong></li></ul></p> <p>In bottom-up approach, each subsystem is tested separately and then the full system is tested. But the top-down integration testing starts with the main routine and one or two subordinate routines in the system. After the top-level ‘skeleton’ has been tested, the immediately subroutines of the ‘skeleton’ are combined with it and tested.</p>\r\n<h3>System Testing</h3>\r\n<p>System testing tends to affirm the end-to-end quality of the entire system. System testing is often based  on the functional / requirement specification of the system. Non-functional quality attributes, such as  reliability, security, and maintainability are also checked. There are three types of system testing</p><ul><li><strong>Alpha testing</strong> is done by the developers who develop the software. This testing is also done by the client or an outsider with the presence of developer or we can say tester.</li><li><strong>Beta testing\r\n</strong>is done by very few number of end users before the delivery, where the change requests are fixed, if the user gives any feedback or reports any type of defect.</li><li><strong>User Acceptance testing </strong>is also another level of the system testing process where the system is tested for acceptability. This test evaluates the system\'s compliance with the client requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for software delivery</ul></p>\r\n<p>An error correction may introduce new errors. Therefore, after every round of error-fixing, another testing is carried out, i.e. called regression testing. Regression testing does not belong to either unit testing, integration testing, or system testing, instead, it is a separate dimension to these three forms of testing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Regression Testing</strong></p><p>The purpose of regression testing is to ensure that bug fixes and new functionality introduced in a software do not adversely affect the unmodified parts of the program <a href=\"/isad/isad/10/references/\">[2]</a>. Regression testing is an important activity at both testing and maintenance phases. When a piece of software is\r\nmodified, it is necessary to ensure that the quality of the software is preserved. To this end, regression testing is to retest the software using the test cases selected from the original test suite. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Example</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Write a program to calculate the square of a number in the range 1-100 </p><p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: cpp;\">\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n\r\nint \r\nmain()  \r\n{ \r\n    int n, res; \r\n    printf(\"Enter a number: \"); \r\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n); \r\n    if (n >= 1 && n <= 100)  \r\n    { \r\n	 res = n * n; \r\n	 printf(\"\\n Square of %d is %d\\n\", n, res); \r\n    } \r\n    else if (n<= 0 || n > 100)    \r\n	 printf(\"Beyond the range\"); \r\n \r\n    return 0; \r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Output</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<pre class=\"brush: bash;\"> Inputs               Outputs		\r\nI1 : -2		O1 :  Beyond the range\r\nI2 :  0 	O2 :  Beyond the range \r\nI3 :  1		O3 :  Square of 1 is 1\r\nI4 : 100	O4 :  Square of 100 is 10000\r\nI5 : 101    O5 :  Beyond the range\r\nI6 : 4      O6 :  Square of 4 is 16\r\nI7 : 62		O7 :  Square of 62 is 3844\r\n</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Test Cases</p>\r\n<p><pre class=\"brush: bash;\">\r\nT1 : {I1 ,O1}\r\nT2 : {I2 ,O2}\r\nT3 : {I3, O3}\r\nT4 : {I4, O4}\r\nT5 : {I5, O5}\r\nT6 : {I6, O6}\r\nT7 : {I7, O7}\r\n</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Some Remarks</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA prevalent misconception among the beginners is that one should be concerned with testing\r\nonly after coding ends. Testing is, in fact, not a phase towards the end. It is rather a continuous\r\nprocess. The efforts for testing should begin in the form of preparation of test cases after the\r\nrequirements have been finalized. The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document\r\ncaptures all features to be expected from the system. The requirements so\r\nidentified here should serve as a basis towards preparation of the test cases. Test\r\ncases should be designed in such a way that all target features could be verified. However,\r\ntesting a software is not only about proving that it works correctly. Successful testing\r\nshould also point out the bugs present in the system, if any.\r\n</p>','<ul>\r\n<li>Learn about different techniques of testing a software</li>\r\n<li>Design unit test cases to verify the functionality and locate bugs, if any </li>\r\n</ul>','3.00','<p>\r\nDevelopment of a new software, like any other product, remains incomplete until it subjected to exhaustive tests. The primary objective of testing is not to verify that all desired features have been implemented correctly. However, it also includes verification of the software behavior in case of &quot;bad inputs&quot;.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this experiment we discuss in brief about different types of testing, and provide mechanisms to have hands-on experience on unit testing.\r\n</p>');
