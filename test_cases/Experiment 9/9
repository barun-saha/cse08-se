	<td>A visual representation of flow of control within a program may help the developer to perform static analysis of his code. One could break down his program into multiple basic blocks, and connect them with directed edges to draw a Control Flow Graph (CFG). A CFG of a program helps in identifying how complex a program is. It also helps to estimate the maximum number of test cases one might require to test the code.</td>

	<td>In this experiment, we will learn about basic blocks and how to draw a CFG using them. We would look into paths and linearly independent paths in context of a CFG. Finally, we would learn about McCabe's cyclomatic complexity, and classify a given program based on that.</td>
