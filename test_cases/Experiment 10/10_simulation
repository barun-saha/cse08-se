	<td>Exhaustive testing of a software is required to determine it is working as per expectations and requirements. Developers often do not have enough time (or at times interest) to test their codes thoroughly. To handle such scenarios, most projects usually have a dedicated testing team. However, unit testing, at least, is done by the developers.</td>
